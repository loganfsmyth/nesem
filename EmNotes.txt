CPU:
* "Produces" cycles for GPU to consume
* Fast lookups very important
** Get it FAST early on so testing is easier later on
** Make very pluggable
*** Different types of cores (interpreter / dynarec)

DMA
* Part of CPU?
* How does this fit in with cycle production?

GPU
* "Comsumes" cycles from CPU
** Triggered on register modification and vblank
* Use register MACROs instead of hardcoded assignment
* Render by pixel into opengl
* Possible accellerations
** Possibly keep tiles in opengl displaylists?
*** Can I use opengl and masking to achieve color changing without modifying displaylist?
** Render one tile at a time?

Mapper
* FAST
** Avoid lots of functions
** No Fancy patterns :P

Input
* Do it late

OpenGL
* Flip only on vblank
